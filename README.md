# Managed OpenShift Roadmap

Welcome to the public roadmap for Managed OpenShift services.
This roadmap includes OpenShift Dedicated (OSD) and Red Hat
OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

For the Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) roadmap refer to the
[Azure OpenShift project](https://github.com/Azure/OpenShift/projects/1).


## Overview

In this roadmap we will present on a best effort basis the
current state of features, fixes and enhancements for our
Managed OpenShift Services. Due to the dynamic nature of our
industry we are not able to provide specific dates for when a
feature will land, but we will provide our best estimates as to
the stage. Also note that the roadmap is subject to change at any
time and without notice.

We created this roadmap with the goal of providing better transparency
to our customers as to the state and future direction of our services.
We believe this will help our customers make better decisions by being
able to access more of the data that they need.


## Structure

The roadmap is broken up into different stages: Backlog (Committed),
In Progress, Coming Soon, and Completed (GA). These are defined as follows:

* **Backlog (Committed):** This section is the list of features that we have
committed to delivering, though work on them has not yet started.
* **In Progress:** List of features that work has started on.
* **Coming Soon:** List of features that are in QE or are being staged for
release to GA.
* **Completed (GA):** Features that are already part of the service.

> **NOTE:** "Feature" above is defined to include features, fixes and enhancements.


## Requests

If you have a feature request, or have identified a bug, please open an issue.
Any proposed issues will be reviewed by our team and may make it onto the roadmap.


## Support

If you have an urgent issue please use the correct channels for obtaining support
for your service (e.g., [Red Hat Support](https://support.redhat.com)). Use of
this forum is on best a effort basis and there should be no expectations for
response times to issues submitted.
